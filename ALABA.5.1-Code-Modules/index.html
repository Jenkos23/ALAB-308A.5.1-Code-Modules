    <h1> Part 1: Math Problems</h1>
    <p>Math is challenging, which is why we have the computer solve the math problems for us. Often in programming, <br> you will need to determine the logic behind an operation, and then tell the computer how to do it. Once you have established that logic, it can be reused. This is how we handle repetitive tasks. </p>
