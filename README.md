# ALAB-308A.5.1-Code-Modules

I selected my ALAB-308.1.1: Data Manipulation with Javascript to modularize the pre-existing code for better organization and future use. I used this  pre-existing code from previous projects. This assigment contains three files index.js, math.js and index.html.

The index.html is living in the global scobe of ALAB-308.1.1 directory, this is the enable me import and export and reuse my code.

In math.js file, I created new function(){} method: costpermiles(), gallonPerMiles() and travelDuration() to make my code look neater as well as not to have too much code in the file
