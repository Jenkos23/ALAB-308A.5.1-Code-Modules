# ALAB-308A.5.1-Code-Modules

I created an ALABA.5.1-Code-Modules directory and copied my ALAB-308.1.1: Data Manipulation with Javascript to modularize this pre-existing code for better organization and future use. I used this pre-existing code from previous projects. This assigment contains three files index.js, math.js and index.html.

The index.html is living in the global scobe of ALABA.5.1-Code-Modules directory, this is to the enable me use import and export keywords and reuse my code.
while the math.js and index.js file lives in  ALAB-308.1.1 directory..

In math.js file, I created new function(){} method: costpermiles(), gallonPerMiles() and travelDuration() to make my code look neater as well as not to have too much code in the file
